* Start with a specific and clear thesis statement that summarizes your main point and guides your writing.
* Write the body of your paper first, covering each aspect of your argument in detail and using evidence to support your claims.
* Revise your thesis statement as you write, making sure it reflects your argument and connects to the body content.
* Write your introduction last, using keywords from your body paragraphs to introduce the topics and provide background for your argument.
* Try different ways of starting your introduction, such as using a surprising fact, a provocative question, a relevant quote, an anecdote, or a historical overview.
* Compare your drafts and choose the one that best fits your topic and writing style.
* Keep your introduction brief and focused, avoiding unnecessary information and definitions. Aim for a similar length to your other paragraphs.

### Introduction Starters

Here are some examples of how to start your introduction, depending on your topic and writing style:

* Surprising Fact: Start with a fact or discovery that surprises or intrigues your reader and relates to your topic.
* Provocative Question: Ask a question that challenges your reader or invites them to participate in your argument.
* Relevant Quote: Use a quote or claim from an expert or authority figure that supports or contrasts your argument.
* Anecdote: Tell a personal story or example that illustrates the impact or importance of your topic.
* Historical Overview: Provide some background or history of your topic to set the stage for your argument.
* New Information: Share some new or interesting information or statistics that your reader might not know about your topic.

Remember, the best introductions are concise, clear, and enticing. Choose the starter that best suits your topic and writing style to grab your reader’s attention from the very first sentence.

### Phrases to Avoid in Your Introduction & Alternatives

Here are some phrases that you should avoid in your introduction, and some alternatives that you can use instead:

* **Overgeneralizations**: Don’t use words like “Everywhere”, “All…”, or “Every single” that make sweeping or vague statements. Be more specific and use quantifiers like “Many”, “Most”, “Few”, or “None” if necessary.
* **Absolutes**: Don’t use words like “Never…”, “Forever…/Always…” that imply certainty or permanence. Use more nuanced adverbs like “Many times…”, “Often…”, “Nowadays…”, or “In recent times…” that show variation or change.
* **Weakening Phrases**: Don’t use phrases like “Some people may disagree but…”, “I think…”, “In the world…/In all the world…”, “Few…”, or “Rarely…” that weaken your argument or make it sound subjective. Be more confident and assertive in your statements. If applicable, directly address opposing viewpoints (“Those who disagree argue…”).
* **Redundancy and Explanation**: Don’t use phrases like “Everyone agrees that…”, “A common phenomenon is…” that state the obvious or explain what your reader already knows. Focus on presenting new, surprising, or controversial information that supports your argument.
* **Unnecessary Definitions**: Don’t use phrases like “The dictionary defines…”, “According to Webster’s…” that provide definitions that your reader can easily understand or look up. Use clear and concise language that conveys your meaning.

Remember:

* Begin with a strong statement that introduces something new, surprising, or controversial about your topic.
* Use evidence and data to back up your claims.
* Avoid weak claims and unnecessary explanations.
* Be clear, concise, and confident in your writing.
